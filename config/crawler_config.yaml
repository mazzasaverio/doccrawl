# Document Crawler Configuration Guide
# 
# This configuration file defines the crawling strategy for different types of document sources.
# Each URL is classified into one of five types (0-4), each with specific behaviors:
#
# Type 0 - Direct Target URLs:
#   - Direct links to target documents (e.g., direct PDF links)
#   - No crawling depth (max_depth must be 0)
#   - No seed_pattern needed
#   - Example use: Known document URLs that don't require crawling
#
# Type 1 - Single Page with Targets:
#   - Pages containing target document links
#   - No crawling depth (max_depth must be 0)
#   - No seed_pattern needed
#   - Uses target_patterns to identify document links
#   - Example use: Archive pages with document listings
#
# Type 2 - Seed and Target Pages:
#   - Pages containing both seed URLs and target documents
#   - Crawls one level deep (max_depth must be 1)
#   - Requires seed_pattern to identify next-level pages
#   - Uses target_patterns to identify documents
#   - Example use: Index pages with links to archive sections
#   - Skip seeds already present in frontier table
#
# Type 3 - Complex AI-Assisted:
#   - Three-level crawling strategy:
#     * Depth 0: Uses seed_pattern and target_patterns
#     * Depth 1: Uses ScrapegraphAI to identify both seeds and targets
#     * Depth 2: Only collects targets matching target_patterns
#   - Requires max_depth = 2
#   - Requires seed_pattern for initial crawling
#   - Skip seeds already present in frontier table
#
# Type 4 - Full AI-Assisted:
#   - Multi-level crawling with AI assistance:
#     * Depth 0-1: Uses ScrapegraphAI to identify both seeds and targets
#     * Final depth: Only collects targets matching target_patterns
#   - Configurable max_depth (must be â‰¥ 2)
#   - No initial seed_pattern required (fully AI-driven)
#   - Skip seeds already present in frontier table
#
# Common Configuration Elements:
# - target_patterns: List of regex patterns identifying target documents
#   Examples:
#   - ".*\.pdf$" : Matches URLs ending in .pdf
#   - ".*/doc/\d+$" : Matches URLs like "/doc/123"
#   - ".*/document/[a-zA-Z0-9-]+$" : Matches document URLs with alphanumeric IDs
#
# - seed_pattern: Regex pattern identifying URLs to crawl next
#   Examples:
#   - "/archive/\d{4}/$" : Matches year-based archive sections
#   - "/section/[a-zA-Z0-9-]+/$" : Matches section URLs
